This folder is intended to contain all of the code for a 2025 paper on MHD turbulence at Jupiter using Juno data. The goal is to put all dependecies into a class struture and then pull functions from there into working python files.

For now, this will serve as a place to put the most updated pieces of the code as of June 2, 2025 so that they can be uploaded to Github and updated from there.
